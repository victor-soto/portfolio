      "description": "At Forward, I developed and maintained a platform of components and tools to support U.S. public sector leaders, improving efficiency and compliance. I enhanced communication services for government programs through SMS, calls, video conferencing, and email, while designing API improvements that cut response times by 50%. I built a scalable service for multichannel notifications, strengthened API security, and optimized performance with caching, AWS cost reductions of 20%, and database tuning. Additionally, I delivered key features requested by Product Managers, automating processes and reducing manual work by 50%.",
