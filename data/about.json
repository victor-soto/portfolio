    "With over 10 years of experience as a Full Stack Software Engineer, my core focus is on developing high-performing, scalable, and reliable microservices and distributed systems. My work is driven by a strong desire to build technology that is not only high-performing and reliable but also scalable. I have a lot of experience with a variety of technologies, including JavaScript, NestJS, TypeScript, ReactJS, Java, Spring Boot, and AWS, and I can show many good results. For example, in a previous role, I successfully improved the use of AWS services, which cut costs by 20% without affecting availability.",
    "My approach to software development is grounded in key engineering principles such as Clean Architecture, SOLID, TDD, KISS, and DRY, ensuring the delivery of clean, maintainable, and efficient code. I have also led a small team of developers, where I helped to improve code quality. For instance, I refactored some code to reduce dependencies and achieved over 85% code coverage by writing a lot of unit tests.",
    "Even though I am an expert in backend development, I am always learning new skills. I am currently having one year of experience as a fullstack developer with React, so I can have a complete understanding of how applications work. I also stay current with emerging technologies, including AI and LLMs, to continuously enhance my skills and approach to modern engineering."
