    "With over 14 years of professional experience, I have developed a strong career as a backend software engineer. My main focus is on creating and improving microservices and distributed systems. My work is driven by a strong desire to build technology that is not only high-performing and reliable but also scalable. I have a lot of experience with a variety of technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, NestJS, and AWS, and I can show many good results. For example, in a previous role, I successfully improved the use of AWS services, which cut costs by 20% without affecting availability.",
    "My approach to software development is based on key engineering principles. I always follow rules like Clean Architecture, SOLID, TDD, KISS, and DRY to make sure my code is clean, easy to maintain, and efficient. I have also led a small team of developers, where I helped to improve code quality. For instance, I refactored some code to reduce dependencies and achieved over 85% code coverage by writing a lot of unit tests.",
    "Even though I am an expert in backend development, I am always learning new skills. I am currently learning frontend technologies because I want to have a complete understanding of how applications work. I also keep up with the latest trends in technology, especially AI and LLMs, so I can always be a modern and effective engineer."
